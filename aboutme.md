Effectuall provides an effective and powerful 3D learning platform for Interactive Physics Simulations. It introduces a teaching methodology that uses technology as access points for guiding students in science.
## Effect of Visual Learning - Effectual Learning 


All of the simulations in this site are created by me, **E.P Sajitha**. Please click on my name to send feedback about the simulation contents, visualisations or suggestions for new simulations.
More simulations' modules from Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education are to be added at regular intervals.

The ensemble of Interactive Physics simulations in 3D are developed using open source [**Three.js-JavaScript 3D Library**](https://threejs.org/).
